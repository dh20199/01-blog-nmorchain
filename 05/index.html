            <p>More than a thousand delignates showed up to the Paris Peace Conference—their work culminating in signing of the Treaty of Versailles—, yet all parties left Paris dissatisfied (Marks, The ebbing of European ascendancy, pg. 84). <br>
                Germany had been promised a ‘Wilsonian’ peace which respected German self-determination, yet Poland’s acquisition of access to the Baltic Sea directly denied them that and Germans saw the reparations payments as unfair and detrimental to their economy. While the armistice was a practical surrender by Germany, the Allies failed to communicate this to the German public—no fighting had been done on German soil and her armies had not been forced out but rather withdrew following the armistice. Thus, Article 231 (better known as the ‘War Guilt Clause’) became the symbol of Germany’s dissatisfaction with the treaty and was used by the Nazi Regime as fodder for their propaganda (Spiegel, World politics, pg. 100). <br>
                Wilson failed to bring about the new world order which he had hoped to impose on Europe. Instead, he left with a weak League of Nations, which had no real power to impose justice, democracy, or freedom onto the world. <br>
                Lloyd George favoured softer penalties against Germany, yet had promised the British that, for their part in the war, they would receive considerable bounty. Yet America, France, and even himself, made this impossible. <br>
                Clemenceau came to the Paris Conference with the clearest goals: he wanted tangible guarantees of France’s security. Yet the treaty had considerably few means of enforcement and relied heavily on the cooperation of Germans, who detested the treaty (Marks, The ebbing of European ascendancy, pg. 96). <br>
                The Treaty of Versailles reflected a little of what each party involved wanted. But it is precisely for this reason that the treaty was a failure. Clemenceau wanted to break Germany’s teeth; the Anglo-Americans favoured a treaty of pinpricks. The result was enough pinpricks to anger Germany but not enough to keep Her down. They had wounded German pride but left Germany strong. This coupled with Hitler and the rise of National Socialism in Germany, paved the way for what would become World War 2.
